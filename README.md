# priorityscheduler
SJSU CmpE 130 Group Project

The objective of the project is to create a scheduling system that helps the user become more efficient and organized. The user can choose how they would like to prioritize their schedule based off of some of the given options. Based off of the chosen option, the system will automatically schedule the tasks that were input by the user. 

A few of the possible algorithms that will be implemented is: first come first serve, shortest job first, round robin, or multilevel queue. First Come First Serve Scheduling ensures that jobs are executed on first come and first serve basis. The Shortest-Job-First Scheduling is the best way to shorten the waiting time. Priority Scheduling ensures that priority is assigned for each process. Round Robin makes sure that quantum is allocated for execution. Multilevel Queue Scheduling makes it possible for different queues to have different priorities. Some of the data structures that will be implemented are sort, queue, and stack.
